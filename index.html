    <!-- 

    NOTES:

    use the key events to listen for the letters your players will type
    display on the page: 
    Press any key to get started!
    Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly)
    if the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts 
    as the user guesses the correct letters reveal them (example: m_ d_nn_)
    
    1. number of guesses remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user)
    2. letters already guessed: (letters the user has guessed as LZYH)
    3. After the user wins or loses, the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

    1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo
    2. Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your games theme
    3. HARD MODE: org the game code as an object, except for hte key events to get the 
        letter guessed. 
    4. Save the whole game and its properties in an object
    5. Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using 
       event listeners.
    6. Don't forget to place your game's functions as methods, and call them underneathyour object declaration using event listeners.

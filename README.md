# **Word Guess Game**

Word Guess Game is a simple game built with JavaScript/JQuery, HTMl + CSS. The code plays a jazz audio file at the end of each round of the game.

At the beginning of the game, the player is presented with an empty scoreboard, blank letter spaces and a prompt to select a letter. If the player selects a correct letter, it will fill one (or more) of the blank letter spaces. Incorrect letters are tallied as incorrect on the scoreboard. The scoreboard also displays guesses remaining, wins and losses. At the end of the game, jazz music plays in the background.
